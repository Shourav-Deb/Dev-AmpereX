## ℹ What is Dev AmpereX?
Dev AmpereX is a dashboard that shows smart plug electricity usage in a clear and friendly way, including live readings, usage trends, and simple cost estimation. Built to demonstrate how real-time usage visibility can improve efficiency, reduce waste, and support greener energy habits.

**Live Demo:** **[Dev AmpereX](dev-amperex.streamlit.app)**


## 🔑 Key Benefits
- **Real-time visibility:** See what devices are consuming right now (Watt, Voltage, Current).
- **Usage trends:** Visual graphs help you understand daily and monthly patterns.
- **Cost awareness:** Estimate energy cost based on usage so you can make better decisions.
- **Faster troubleshooting:** Spot unusual spikes and device-level waste early.
- **Scalable concept:** Designed like a “building-ready” monitoring system (houses, rooms, device groups).

## 🧩 Two Modes
**Demo Mode (Simulation)**
- Works instantly with realistic synthetic data.
- Best for exploring the full experience without any setup or hardware.

**Real Mode (Tuya Cloud)**
- Connects to real Tuya smart plugs using your Tuya API credentials.
- Shows real live device readings and supports control and basic scheduling behavior.



## 📘 Want the full guide?
The dashboard includes a built-in **Help / Manual** section that explains:
- How to use Demo Mode and Real Mode
- How credential verification works
- Device dashboard features
- Schedules and usage insights

If you want deeper details, open the site and read the **Help / Manual** panel.

## 🤝 Interested in a tailored version?

This project demonstrates what a clean, production-style monitoring dashboard can look like.
If you want something similar for your home, office, shop, restaurant, or multi-floor building, a custom version can be built with your branding, device structure, and reporting needs.
